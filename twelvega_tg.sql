This time around, things are getting serious. Power\'s new LP is eleven tracks featuring the band\'s signature hard-hitting hardcore sound, and a cover of Black Sabbath\'s Sweet Leaf (who would\'ve guessed?). This record keeps up with the tradition record of being fast-paced, pissed off and loud giving the listener no chance to lose focus.\r\n<p>Bremerton Zoo was recorded by Rusty Graeff during the months of July and August in Tacoma, WA and mastered by Chris Matthews Jr. at Joonior Studios.','Sam Black Church, Biohazard, Onyx, Nirvana','San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, Las Vegas, Orlando, New York City, Detroit, Phoenix, Salt Lake City','','Out Now','<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 460px; height: 130px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2022299670/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=ff5247/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://music.tgrex.com/album/bremerton-zoo\">Bremerton Zoo by Power</a></iframe>',32,''),('033','TG033','No Sir','The Future Is Bright','12\"LP, Digital','2013-08-13','nosir','<ol>\r\n<li>Intro\r\n<li>The Crowd\r\n<li>C.A.L.I.F.O.R.N.I.A.\r\n<li>Anxiety Consumption\r\n<li>I Doubt You\'ll Ever Swim Again\r\n<li>Wet Worlds\r\n<li>I Pushed Back, Violently\r\n<li>Interlude\r\n<li>The Baseline Percentage\r\n<li>Bad Vibes\r\n<li>Momma I\'m A Good Boy\r\n</ol>','<p>From Santa Rosa, California, No Sir (featuring members of Sabertooth Zombie and Creative Adult) hail from within a flourishing circle of current West Coast hardcore punk bands - bands like Ghostlimb, Loma Prieta, Punch, Trash Talk, and Ceremony. Varying in style, these Golden State bands of today are bonded by a general aesthetic: highly artistic and intellectual yet determined to keep things raw, lo-fi, and DIY. Gut-level music for the thinking man. No Sir are representatives of this modern scene but can also be understood in a historical context, as heirs to the legacy of an older generation of Californians - the extreme hardcore punk bands that have filled the pages of Maximumrocknroll for years, from Dead and Gone to Talk Is Poison to Look Back and Laugh.\r\n<p>If you ask No Sir themselves, they\'ll add Wire and Nirvana to their list of influences too. All these references points are evident on the debut full-length, The Future Is Bright, as the band balance gloomy introspection and forward-charging aggression with a perfect sense of rock songwriting that makes every song as much a hummable hit as a punk rock exorcism.\r\n<p>Engineered, mixed, and mastered by Comadre guitarist Jack Shirley at The Atomic Garden, The Future Is Bright was tracked live in the studio to capture the true energy of the band. Shirley is a go-to producer for the West Coast scene, having helped make records for Deafheaven, Graf Orlock, Ghostlimb, Loma Prieta, and more.','Discharge, Negative Approach, Nirvana','San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Boston, Las Vegas, Orlando, New York City, Detroit, Phoenix, Salt Lake City','','Out Now','<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 460px; height: 130px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=710562126/size=medium/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=ff5247/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://music.tgrex.com/album/the-future-is-bright\">The Future Is Bright by No Sir</a></iframe>',33,''),('034','TG034','Nervous','Nervous','12\"LP, Digital','2013-09-24','nervous','<ol>\r\n<li>Good Morning\r\n<li>Cog In The Machine\r\n<li>Day Off\r\n<li>Perfection\r\n<li>Home\r\n<li>Birthday Party\r\n<li>Satire About A Vampire\r\n<li>Vulture\r\n<li>Hungry\r\n<li>Can’t Feel A Thing\r\n</ol>','<p>Hot on the heels of No Sir\'s The Future Is Bright, Twelve Gauge Records presents its next home run: the self-titled debut album by Nervous, out September 24th.\r\n<p>From Oakland, California, Nervous consists of frontman Jake Spek (Lewd Acts) and drummer Jacob Harris (Big Kids, Acid Fast). Best friends and co-pilots of Oakland DIY venue The Hive, Spek and Harris have announced Nervous to be their new priority. This is no side project, it\'s a real band with its own sound.\r\n<p>There\'s something of a Nirvana vibe with Nervous - or, more accurately, the band is inspired by many of the same bands Kurt Cobain espoused: Wipers, Pixies, The Jesus Lizard. Spek and Harris take these inspirations and twist them into anxiety-ridden California punk anthems. Spek\'s unhinged vocals are an absolute standout, something like David Yow in a really fired-up mood. His lyrics address true everyday struggles of the broke, lazy, and intelligent, and honesty seeps through his every word. When Spek sings about being depressed, it\'s not depressing - on the contrary, he pulls you right in and makes you want to shout along, and you\'re left applauding him for having the courage to be so real. From the album\'s opening track, \"Good Morning\": \"Absolutely no sense of urgency / Not going to work, that is a certainty / I don\'t want to hang out, that shit is boring / I got a cut on my leg that won\'t stop bleeding / I think that I\'m decomposing\".\r\n<p>Recorded and mixed by Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Loma Prieta) and mastered by Alan Douches (Converge and so many more), Nervous\' self-titled debut sounds clear and rich, rock-solid and rocking.

Clean guitars strum urgently and break into surf rock tones as bare-bones drums and bass pound out tight Crass-like cadences. The band – Spek, drummer Jacob Harris, and bassist Conrad Nichols – name influences like The Melvins, Born Against, and the entire rosters of Ebullition and Dischord Records. \r\n\r\nSpek says Duration and Delusion is a record about time: \"It\'s about our understanding of time and how it controls us. How our understanding of it shapes how we approach everything. Time as a power structure and a tool used in the reproduction of capital. The limitations imposed by structures we ourselves have created and abide by. The police. The state. Capitalism. People taking the streets. And weed, of course.
