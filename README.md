# TG-Record(keeping)
TG-R(K) is an accounting solution for a small indepennt record label operating on the go. With multiple income sources and pretty unpredictable expenses, a quick and easy solution for keeping track of expenses, and a way to make sense of the various income sources (each with their own data structures) is necessary.

## What is it?
A webapp that keeps track of Twelve Gauge Records' finance. Income and expenses are entered into a webapp and tracked in a dataabase for further analytics.

## Why?
Expneses are spontaneous and it's easy to forgot to properly account for all cash flow movements making it harder and riskier to file proper taxes.
